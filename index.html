		<p style = "font-size: 25px">You’re at home or in quarantine and need to keep yourself active and productive. For many, this lock down period has given more time on our hands than we have ever had. Time which we never thought we would have. Being in quarantine is a new experience and our mental health care can be declining. We have never known a life of strictly working from home, only going out for groceries, and not being able to visit family and friends.</p> 
		<p style = "font-size: 25px">Concerts are postponed, Sporting events are cancelled, Schools are closed and tourists hotspots are shut down, experts recommend that even those who show no sign of illness, to stay home during this time global pandemic.
	       
	    	
		So what is there to do when you’re sitting at home, peeping through your window, thinking about life that once was. Scrolling through social media is not great for your mental health. So as we adjust to this new reality, here are a few ideas of what you can do to keep busy and keep routine while you’re under quarantine.</p>

		<h2>
		READING BOOKS </h2>
		

		
		<p style = "font-size: 25px">

		First on this list, is very much where you should be starting. Books exercise the brain, build our vocabularies, lower stress and also enhances the imagination. Reading makes you more empathetic. Reading is a way to escape your own life, can take you to faraway lands, other times, and put you in other people’s shoes. Reading reduces stress. Learning to read is about listening and understanding as well as working out what is printed on the page. Thought hearing stories, children are exposed to a wide range of words. This helps them build. Their own vocabulary and improve their understanding when they listen, which is vital as they start to read.</font></p>

		<h2>
		COOKING</h2>
		<p style = "font-size: 25px">
		Involving your children in food preparation (may be by asking them to read the recipe out loud or mix ingredients) is not only a fun thing to do, but also a great way to teach them healthy eating habits.</p>

		<h3>
			Good foods to eat during the COVID19 pandemic:
		</h3>

		<p style = "font-size: 25px">
			You should eat a variety of fresh and unprocessed foods every day to get the vitamins, minerals, dietary fibre, protein and antioxidants your body needs. Drink enough water eat fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts and whole grains.
			For snacks, choose raw vegetables and fresh fruits, rather than foods that are high in sugar, fat (or) salt.

		<h2>
			GET ARTISTIC 
		</h2>
		<p style = "font-size: 25px">
			Art opens the heart and mind to possibilities and fuels the imagination. Art is a process of learning to create ourselves and experience the world in new ways. It supports the bigger view of life: beauty, symbols, spirituality of storytelling and allows us to be present in the moment. Art keeps the magic alive.

Make time to catch up and have a virtual drink with you friends and family. I also feel that reconnecting with past colleagues is a great idea. You would have spent a lot of time with these people in previous roles and might have grown apart as you move on your career.
